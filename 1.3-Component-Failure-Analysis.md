# Component Failure Analysis

## Guidance

## Preparation

Leverage the [Technical Dependency Analysis](1.2-Technical-Dependency-Analysis.md) to identify the services for each business process.

## Procedure

### 1. Conduct a Component Failure Analysis

* Using a spreadsheet, create a grid with business processes on one axis and the dependent Azure services  on the other.

 | __Business Process/Function__ | __Service 1__ |__Service 2__ |__Service 3__ |__...__ |__Service n__ |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Process 1   |   |    |    |    |    |
| Process 2   |   |    |    |    |    |
| Process 3  |   |    |    |    |    |
| Process ...   |   |    |    |    |    |
| Process n   |   |    |    |    |    |

* Leave a blank when a failure of the Azure service does not impact the business process in any ways;
* Insert an ‘X’ when the failure of the Azure service causes the business process to be inoperative;
* Insert an ‘A’ when there is an alternative to provide the service; and
* Insert an ‘M’ when there is an alternative service, but the service requires manual intervention to be recovered.

### 2. Conduct and Impact Assessment

* Identify Single Points of Failure (SPoF)
* Identify the Business/Customer impact of this service failing in terms of users and / or business cost.
* Identify the probability of failure and mitigation approaches to avoid this impact.
  * Design changes to prevent this impact
  * Redundancy or some form of resiliency
  * Additional cost considerations
