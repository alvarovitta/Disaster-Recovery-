When to use 


 


Use the procedure described in this section to implement disaster for PaaS database workloads. This scenario includes Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, and Data Lake. 


 


Guidance 


Azure SQL 

Leverage Azure SQL Database and Cosmos DB  geo-replication to configure secondary database replicas in other regions. Secondary databases are available for querying and for failover in the case of a data center outage or the inability to connect to the primary database.  


[Azure SQL Business Continuity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-business-continuity) capabilities support standard geo-replication or active-geo-replication.  

Standard geo-replication: designed for applications that are using geo-replication  to achieve disaster recovery SLA. 


Active geo-replication: designed for the applications with  high-volume read-oriented workload could benefit from read-scale load balancing in addition to fast disaster recovery. 


To achieve RPO of < 5 seconds and recovery times of less than 30 seconds active geo-replication is required. 




 


Azure SQL Data Warehouse 

By default, SQL Data Warehouse performs a geo-backup once per day to a paired data center. The RPO for a geo-restore is 24 hours. You can restore the geo-backup to a server in any other region where SQL Data Warehouse is supported. A geo-backup ensures SQL data warehouse can be restored in case the snapshots cannot be accessed in your primary region. 



 


Redis Cache 

The disaster recovery posture of Redis Cache depends on its usage pattern. When used for web user session caching, geo-replication is generally not required. However, messaging and distributed transaction scenarios may require geo-replication to ensure recoverability requirements can be met. 



 


Cosmos DB 

Cosmos DB failover handling is automatic without requiring code change of any kind.  


SDK is auto-homing and will failover to next available region in the chosen list of regions. 


There is no availability, performance loss during a manual failover. During DR-based failover potential unreplicated changes can be merged when the region returns to normal database situation.
