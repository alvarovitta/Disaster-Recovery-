# Database Workloads

## When to use

Use the procedure described in this section to implement disaster for PaaS database workloads. This scenario includes Azure Redis Cache, Azure SQL, Cosmos DB.

## Guidance

### Azure SQL

* Leverage Azure SQL Database and Cosmos DB  geo-replication to configure secondary database replicas in other regions. Secondary databases are available for querying and for failover in the case of a data center outage or the inability to connect to the primary database.

* [Azure SQL Business Continuity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-business-continuity) capabilities support standard geo-replication or active-geo-replication.

* **Standard geo-replication:** designed for applications that are using geo-replication  to achieve disaster recovery SLA.
* **Active geo-replication:** designed for the applications with  high-volume read-oriented workload could benefit from read-scale load balancing in addition to fast disaster recovery.
* To achieve RPO of < 5 seconds and recovery times of less than 30 seconds active geo-replication is required.

### Azure SQL Data Warehouse

* By default, SQL Data Warehouse performs a [geo-backup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-data-warehouse/backup-and-restore#geo-redundant-backups) once per day to a paired data center. The RPO for a geo-restore is 24 hours. You can restore the geo-backup to a server in any other region where SQL Data Warehouse is supported. A geo-backup ensures SQL data warehouse can be restored in case the snapshots cannot be accessed in your primary region.
* Some data loss may occur if SQL DW tables are updated after the last geo back up was created.
* Since this geo-redundant backup is copied to a Standard storage, depending on how much data you have, restore can take a long time. As a result, Azure SQL DW may not be suited to stringent Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) scenarios.

Azure Data Lake Store
We recommend that you copy your critical data to another Data Lake Store account in another region with a frequency aligned to the needs of your disaster recovery plan. There are a variety of methods to copy data including ADLCopy, Azure PowerShell or Azure Data Factory. Azure Data Factory is a useful service for creating and deploying data movement pipelines on a recurring basis. We recommend to do this every 24h unless your analytics pipeline run more frequently than daily.
If a regional outage occurs, you can then access your data in the region where the data was copied. You can monitor the Azure Service Health Dashboard to determine the Azure service status across the globe.
Azure Data Lake Analytics
Here we recommend using infrastructure as code to create a deployment script (either using ARM templates or PowerShell) to redeploy the data lake analytics service and the RBAC associated with it. See Azure Data factory strategy in this document.


### Redis Cache

* The disaster recovery posture of Redis Cache depends on its usage pattern. When used for web user session caching, geo-replication is generally not required. However, messaging and distributed transaction scenarios may require geo-replication to ensure recoverability requirements can be met.
* Applications leveraging Redis Cache will need to be able to discern when they are operating in a failover scenario to identify the appropriate Redis Cache endpoint.

### Cosmos DB

* Cosmos DB failover handling is automatic without requiring code change of any kind.
* SDK is auto-homing and will failover to next available region in the chosen list of regions.
* There is no availability, performance loss during a manual failover. During DR-based failover potential unreplicated changes can be merged when the region returns to normal database situation.
* see [How to distribute data globally with Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/distribute-data-globally) and [Automatic regional failover for business continuity in Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/regional-failover)

## Procedure

## 1. Azure SQL Geo-Replication and Failover Groups

* [Failover groups and active geo-replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-geo-replication-overview)

## 2. Azure Redis Cache Geo-Replication

* If the data in Azure Redis Cache must be preserved to support the business continuity objectives enable Azure Redis Cache Geo-Replication as described in [How to configure Geo-replication for Azure Redis Cache](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/redis-cache/cache-how-to-geo-replication)


## 3. Azure Cosmos DB Geo-Replication

[Add global database regions for Cosmos D](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/tutorial-global-distribution-sql-api) and [How to distribute data globally with Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/distribute-data-globally)

## 4. Restore Azure SQL Data warehouse

* [Restoring from restore points](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-data-warehouse/backup-and-restore) and [Geo-redundant restore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-data-warehouse/backup-and-restore)
