Microsoft Azure Storage is the Microsoft-managed cloud service that provides storage in the Azure cloud. It consists of three data services: Blob Storage, File Storage and Queue Storage.  


Azure Storage can be used as a discreet service, or it can underpin other Azure services that you are consuming. Data is stored in storage accounts. 


At the region level, this is referred to as Locally-Redundant storage (LRS) which means that multiple copies of your data are maintained in a given region. 


## When to Use 

For Disaster Recovery in case of a region outage, Geo-Redundant Storage is designed to provide 16 9s durability by maintaining the local copies of your data in the primary region plus another set of copies of your data in the secondary region (ex: Canada Central is replicated to Canada East) 


When a regional disaster affects a primary region, Microsoft will try to restore the service in that region. Dependent upon the nature of the disaster and its impacts, in some rare occasions we may not be able to restore the primary region. At that point, we will perform a geo-failover.  

| __Advantages__ | __Disadvantages__ |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|
|At all times, Azure will keep and manage multiple copies of your data.  | Before and during the geo-failover, you won't have write access to your storage account due to the impact of the disaster but you can still read from the secondary if your storage account has been configured as RA-GRS   | 
| Storage geo-failover will only be triggered by the Azure Storage team â€“ there is no customer action required.   | | 
| Existing storage service endpoints for blobs, tables, queues, and files will remain the same after the failover; the Microsoft-supplied DNS entry will need to be updated to switch from the primary region to the secondary region. Microsoft will perform this update automatically as part of the geo-failover process.  | |

## Guidance 


### Azure Blob Storage 

  - When the geo-failover has been completed and the DNS changes propagated, read and write access storage accounts will be resumed if GRS or RA-GRS configured for the storage account.  

  - Query ["Last Geo Failover Time" of your storage account](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/ee460802.aspx)  to get more details noting the value of the following fields: StatusOfPrimary, LastGeoFailoverTime 

  - After the failover, a storage account will be fully functioning, but in a "degraded" status, as it is actually hosted in a standalone region with no geo-replication possible. To mitigate this risk, Microsoft will restore the original primary region and then do a geo-failback to restore the original state. If the original primary region is unrecoverable, we will allocate another secondary region.  

  - For more details on the infrastructure of Azure Storage geo replication, please refer to the article on the Storage team blog about [Redundancy Options and RA-GRS](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsazurestorage/2013/12/11/windows-azure-storage-redundancy-options-and-read-access-geo-redundant-storage/). 


### Azure Data Lake 

  - Critical Data is Azure Data Lakes should be copied to  another Data Lake Store account in another region with a frequency aligned to the needs of the disaster recovery plan.

### Procedure 


**1. Azure Blob Storage** 

  - Enable Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) Replication on storage account. See replication options under [create a general purpose storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&tabs=portal#create-a-general-purpose-storage-account) 

**2. Azure Data Lake**

  - Azure Data Factory is a useful service for creating and deploying data moveeverage [ADLCopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-copy-data-azure-storage-blob), [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-get-started-powershell) or [Azure Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/connector-azure-data-lake-store)ment pipelines on a recurring basis.
