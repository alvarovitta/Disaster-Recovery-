Use this guide to plan and execute disaster recovery simulations to confirm recovery point and recovery time estimate, identify gaps, and mitigation plans. 


 


Guidance 

 


The intent of this testing is to evaluate the feasibility of the recovery plan and highlight any issues that were inadequately addressed.  


Execute simulations so that the created scenarios don't disrupt actual business, while still simulating real situations. 


The simulated scenarios must be completely controllable such that services can be restored even if the tested recovery plan fails. 


Ensure  any regulatory reporting requirements related to DR are considerer 


Refer to disaster simulation in Disaster recovery for Azure applications. 



 


Preparation 


 

Determine the tolerance for production downtime during DR testing affects the design. There are three basic scenarios: 

Zero tolerance for production downtime – the DR test must be executed without bringing down production. 


Regular Maintenance Window – the DR test must be executed during a regular maintenance window. 


Extended Maintenance Window – special allowance is made for an extended outage during the DR test 



Define the level of integration testing that will be required during the DR test. This covers integration into existing 3rd systems and 3rd party systems 


Define data consistency  requirements on how data consistency (between DR and Prod) is confirmed. 


Define the scope of DR testing process:  full regression testing of the entire system, functional testing, or smoke testing.
