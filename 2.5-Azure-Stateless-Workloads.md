# Azure Stateless Workloads

Use the procedure described in this section to implement disaster for stateless workloads.

## When to use

This scenario could apply to the following: stateless app servers running on Virtual Machines, Platform Services such as Logic Apps and Functions that use storage accounts as back-end storage

## Guidance

* Consider Re-Deployment through automation over replication when feasible for stateless layers.
* Stateless servers should be redeployed using Infrastructure as Code (ARM templates) when feasible. Leverage template parameters to minimize the changes required to the templates.
* Asynchronously replicate the data stores (such as SQL Azure database, Blob Storage, or CosmosDB) using the respective features of these services such as using Geo-Redundant Storage or other Platform services
* If RTO does not allow time for redeployment, the recommendation is to deploy all primary region resources in a secondary region also. Primary region resources include:
  * Azure Service Bus
  * Azure Event Hubs
  * Azure API Management
  * Azure Logic Apps
  * Azure Functions and Function Proxies

* Access to stateless workload data sets can be insured by replicating the data layer using Geo-Redundant Storage or other Platform services.

| __Advantages__ | __Disadvantages__ |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) maximizes availability for your storage account. RA-GRS provides read-only access to the data in the secondary location, in addition to geo-replication across two regions.    | Applications manage which endpoint it is interacting with when using RA-GRS. ( The secondary endpoint is similar to the primary endpoint, but appends the suffix â€“secondary to the account name)   |
| Azure Storage typically has an RPO of less than 15 minutes  | The proposed solution assumes that it is acceptable to return potentially stale data to the calling application. Because data in the secondary region is eventually consistent, it is possible the primary region may become inaccessible before an update to the secondary region has finished replicating.  |

### Service Bus

* The disaster recovery feature implements metadata disaster recovery, and relies on primary and secondary disaster recovery namespaces. Note that the Geo-disaster recovery feature is available for the [Premium SKU](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-premium-messaging) only.

* By pairing azure service bus namespaces in different regions an alias can be created.  The alias provides a single stable Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) connection string. Applications use this alias connection string to connect to a namespace.

* Consider creating a durable client-side queue as a backup.

### Event Hubs

* Event Hub, much like Service Bus, requires the pairing of namespaces across regions as described in [Azure Event Hubs Geo-disaster recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-geo-dr). The Geo-disaster recovery feature is globally available for the Event Hubs Standard SKU.

* By pairing Azure Event Hub namespaces in different regions an alias can be created.  The alias provides a single stable Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) connection string. Applications use this alias connection string to connect to a namespace.

### API Management

* The service "backup and restore" feature provides the necessary building block for implementing your disaster recovery strategy. Backup is a long running operation that may take multiple minutes to complete.
* Restore is a long running operation that may take up to 30 or more minutes to complete.

### Function Apps

* With Azure Durable Functions all state is persisted in Azure Storage.

### Logic Apps

* Deploy Logic Apps can be deployed through ARM templates in multiple regions to achieve redundancy in either active, or passive (disabled) mode.
* *Note that Logic Apps endpoints are not supported by Traffic Manager, therefore traffic cannot be redirected dynamically. Options includes:*
  * Making the calling or subscribing application aware of the primary and secondary endpoints so they can call the correct endpoint in the event of a failover.
  * Use API Management to provide an endpoint traffic manager can reach and have API Management can then relay requests to Logic Apps.
  * Use Function App Proxy as a light-weight API management layer.
* For B2B scenarios involving X12, AS2, and EDIFACT, see [Logic Apps B2B cross-region disaster recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-b2b-business-continuity)

### Data Factory

* Manage all the data factory code through a Visual Studio project.

### Azure Batch

* The default number of batch accounts per subscription is 1-3. For production workloads requiring a DR posture, that limit may need to be raised using a customer [support request](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-quota-limit#increase-a-quota).
* Manage all the Azure Batch code through a Visual Studio project and parametrize the following configuration items:
  * Batch account credentials: Batch Account Name,  Batch Account Key, Batch, Account URL
  * Storage account credentials: Storage Account Name, Storage Account Key

### Virtual Machine Scale Set

* Certain workloads, such as web front ends, do not persist state and can be considered stateless. Business continuity for these workloads is achieved by redeploying the scale set and allowing it autoscale to the required configuration.

## Preparation

* Complete the [secondary region pre-requisites](2.2-Azure-Secondary-Region-Prerequisites.md) related to the Azure Integration Account.
* Harden your application by using [Best practices for insulating applications against Service Bus outages and disasters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-outages-disasters). Azure Service Bus patterns recommended [active](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-outages-disasters#active-replication) or [passive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-outages-disasters#passive-replication) replication rely on the client sending the message to service bus queues

## Procedure

### 1. Azure Service Bus

* [Azure Service Bus Setup and Failover Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-geo-dr#setup-and-failover-flow)
* Initiate pairing through Azure Portal Azure Service Bus blade or pair Azure Service Bus namespaces and create a namespace alias with the following: [Enable Service Bus Geo-DR configurations using PowerShell](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/servicebus/2018/02/16/enable-service-bus-geo-dr-configurations-using-powershell/)

### 2. Azure API Management

* Use API Management as the endpoint for Traffic Manager with PowerShell [Add-AzureTrafficManagerEndpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azure/add-azuretrafficmanagerendpoint?view=azuresmps-4.0.0)

* Backup API Management with PowerShell [Backup-AzureRmApiManagement](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azurerm.apimanagement/backup-azurermapimanagement?view=azurermps-1.7.0&redirectedfrom=msdn)

* Restore API Management in secondary region with PowerShell [Restore-AzureRmApiManagement](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/Azure/?view=azuresmps-4.0.0)

### 3. Azure Functions

* This pattern consists of deploying a backup (passive) function app to a different region. Traffic Manager will monitor the primary (active) function app for availability. It will fail over to the backup function app if the primary fails.

* For durable functions, use Read-access geo-redundant storage (-RAGRS), which replicates your data to a secondary region and provides read-only access to the data in the secondary location.

### 4. Azure Logic Apps

* Import Logic App into API Management with [Import a Logic App as an API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/import-logic-app-as-api)

### 5. Azure Data Factory

* Set up a development data factory with VSTS and [continuous integration lifecycle](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/continuous-integration-deployment#continuous-integration-lifecycle) to author Data Factory resources such as pipelines, datasets, and so forth. Redeploy to secondary regions in the event of a primary data center failure.

### 6. Azure Batch

* Execute batch jobs in secondary regions leveraging parameterized configuration items

### 7. Virtual Machine Scale Set

* Redeploy Virtual Machine Scale Set to secondary region using [Virtual Machine Scale Set templates](Learn about virtual machine scale set templates).
