The Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations production environments are configured with disaster recovery support that includes disaster recovery capabilities of stateful and stateless workloads: 

  - Azure SQL active-geo replication for primary databases, with a Recovery Point Estimate (RPO) of < 5 seconds. 
  - Geo-redundant copies of Azure blob storage (containing document attachments) in other Azure regions. 
  - Same secondary region for the Azure SQL and Azure blob storage replications. 

  


### Stateful D365 Components 

The primary data stores are supported for replication. This means that Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations application components, such Management Reporter and Entity store, use transformed data from the primary database, which need to be generated after the recovery site has been set up and the service has started.  


  
### Stateless D365 Components 


Customer code artifacts and recovered data stores is used to re-deploy the site, with a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of up to 10 hours. This will enable state replication of the compute nodes along with networking and other components to set up the secondary site using the recovered data stores. Refer to Table 6 for more information about the roles and responsibilities for disaster recovery 



### API Integration  


Applications that do not link to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 SDK assemblies, for example Java applications that access the web services by using SOAP or ODATA, can try accessing the failover URL for the target organization.  


  
The URL for a failover alternate organization is the same as the URL for the primary organization with “--s” added to the organization name. For example, an organization named Contoso would have the primary and alternate URLs shown in the following table. 


  
| __Primary Organization URL__ | __Alternate Organization URL__ |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| https://contoso.api.crm.dynamics.com   | https://contoso.api.crm.dynamics.com  |

For non.NET-connected applications, there is no notification event to which your application can subscribe to receive notice of a service interruption and failover. Your application will begin to receive a variety of fault exceptions, as listed previously, during the service interruption. At that point, the application can attempt to connect to the failover alternate URL for the target organization. After the disaster has been corrected, a fail back to the primary URL for the organization occurs as part of planned organization maintenance.
