# Technical-Dependency-Analysis
<br />
<br />

## Guidance 
Technical Dependency Analysis (TDA) is a process to define all technology and processes components and key personnel to keep a specific IT capability operational. The Technical Dependency Analysis (TDA) examines the application(s) and supporting infrastructure that a process depends on to determine, at a minimum, the following:   

- Recovery Time Capability (RTC): the technical dependency has been proven through a test and may or may not meet the RTO requirement. 
- Recovery Time Estimate (RTE): the technical dependency has not been proven through a test and the RTC has not been validated.   
- Recovery Point Capability (RPC):  the technical dependency has been proven through a test and may or may not meet the RPO requirement. 
- Recovery Point Estimate (RPE): the technical dependency has not been proven through a test and the RPC has not been validated.

Preparation 


Field 

Recovery Time Capability (RTC),  
or Recovery Time Estimate (RTE), if they haven’t been tested 
Recovery Point Capability (RPC),  
or Recovery Point Estimate (RPE), if they haven’t been tested 
Identify the Primary Production Site 
Identify the Failover Site (if exists) 
Identify the dependent applications to the primary application 
Identify critical systems that are dependent on the primary application 
Identify all Single Points of Failure (SPOF) for the primary application 
Has Disaster Recovery (DR) been implemented (not backups)? 
Is the Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) Available?  
Has the Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) been tested? 
Can DR tests temporarily impact production ? 
What is the last Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) test date? 


## Procedure 

Build Service Dependency Maps 

Service Map can automatically map dependencies between systems to ensure a recovery plan is reliable. This can be accomplished by [configuring service map](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring/monitoring-service-map-configure) in Azure and [using service map](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring/monitoring-service-map) solution in Azure. 




 

Determine Service Recovery Time Capability and Recovery Point Capability. 

Determine dependency RTC, RPC 


Determine aggregate RTC, RTE
