# Business Impact and Risk Assessment

# Guidance 
Disaster recovery planning begin with identifying maximum amount of time a service can be unavailable and the maximum acceptable data loss. The times are expressed as the recovery time objective recovery point objective, respectively: 

* Recovery Time Objective (RTO):  measures the duration of the outage between the time the outage is declared and full restoration of the service to the point that new transactions can take place. 

* Recovery Point Objective (RPO):  the time gap or latency between the last committed data transaction before the failure and the most recent data recovered after the failure. This is often referred to as a measure of acceptable data loss.  

* As part of Disaster Recovery (DR) the RPO and RTO meaningful and realistic values need to be set reflecting both the business implication and technical of invoking disaster recovery plans.  

* RPO and RTO are business driven numbers, that rollup from the RPO and RTO for the technical components that make up the business application.
